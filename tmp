As with previous <unk> Chronicles games , Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role @-@ playing game where players take control of a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces 
 Stories are told through comic book @-@ like panels with animated character portraits , with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through <unk> text 
 The player progresses through a series of linear missions , gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely <unk> through and replayed as they are unlocked 
 The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player 's approach : when one option is selected , the other is sealed off to the player 
 Outside missions , the player characters rest in a camp , where units can be customized and character growth occurs 
 Alongside the main story missions are character @-@ specific sub missions relating to different squad members 
 After the game 's completion , additional episodes are unlocked , some of them having a higher difficulty than those found in the rest of the game 
 There are also love simulation elements related to the game 's two main <unk> , although they take a very minor role 
The game 's battle system , the <unk> system , is carried over directly from <unk> Chronicles 
 During missions , players select each unit using a top @-@ down perspective of the battlefield map : once a character is selected , the player moves the character around the battlefield in third @-@ person 
 A character can only act once per @-@ turn , but characters can be granted multiple turns at the expense of other characters ' turns 
 Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action <unk> 
 Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission 
 During gameplay , characters will call out if something happens to them , such as their health points ( HP ) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks 
 Each character has specific " Potentials " , skills unique to each character 
 They are divided into " Personal Potential " , which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character , and " Battle Potentials " , which are grown throughout the game and always grant <unk> to a character 
 To learn Battle Potentials , each character has a unique " Masters Table " , a grid @-@ based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills 
 Characters also have Special <unk> that grant them temporary <unk> on the battlefield : Kurt can activate " Direct Command " and move around the battlefield without <unk> his Action Point gauge , the character <unk> can shift into her " Valkyria Form " and become <unk> , while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon 
Troops are divided into five classes : Scouts , <unk> , Engineers , <unk> and Armored Soldier 
 <unk> can switch classes by changing their assigned weapon 
 Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class 
 With victory in battle , experience points are awarded to the squad , which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad , a feature differing from early games ' method of distributing to different unit types 
= = Plot = =
The game takes place during the Second Europan War 
 Gallian Army Squad 422 , also known as " The Nameless " , are a penal military unit composed of criminals , foreign <unk> , and military offenders whose real names are erased from the records and <unk> officially referred to by numbers 
 <unk> by the Gallian military to perform the most dangerous missions that the Regular Army and Militia will not do , they are nevertheless up to the task , exemplified by their motto , <unk> <unk> , meaning " Always Ready 
 " The three main characters are <unk> Kurt Irving , an army officer falsely accused of treason who wishes to redeem himself ; Ace <unk> Imca , a female Darcsen heavy weapons specialist who seeks revenge against the Valkyria who destroyed her home ; and <unk> Riela <unk> , a seemingly <unk> young woman who is unknowingly a descendant of the Valkyria 
 Together with their fellow squad members , these three are tasked to fight against a mysterious Imperial unit known as Calamity Raven , consisting of mostly Darcsen soldiers 
As the Nameless officially do not exist , the upper echelons of the Gallian Army exploit the concept of plausible <unk> in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war 
 While at times this works to their advantage , such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory , other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress 
 One such member , <unk> , becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects into the ranks of Calamity Raven , attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader , Dahau 
 At the same time , elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests 
 <unk> by both allies and enemies , and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks , the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive while at the same time fight to help the Gallian war effort 
 This continues until the Nameless 's commanding officer , Ramsey Crowe , who had been kept under house arrest , is escorted to the capital city of <unk> in order to present evidence <unk> the weary soldiers and expose the real traitor , the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason 
<unk> due to these events , and partly due to the major losses in manpower Gallia suffers towards the end of the war with the Empire , the Nameless are offered a formal position as a squad in the Gallian Army rather than serve as an anonymous shadow force 
 This is short @-@ lived , however , as following Maximilian 's defeat , Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient <unk> super weapon within the Empire , kept secret by their benefactor 
 Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia , it is Dahau 's last <unk> card in creating a new Darcsen nation 
 As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations ' cease @-@ fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless , asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed @-@ in @-@ action 
 Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the <unk> weapon 
 Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives <unk>

Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this 
 The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III 
 Development work took approximately one year 
 After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series 
 Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the " revolutionary " idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 
 Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series ' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform 
 In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by <unk> The original scenario was written <unk> <unk> , while the script was written by Hiroyuki <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor 
The majority of material created for previous games , such as the <unk> system and the design of maps , was carried over 
 Alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission 
 A part of this upgrade involved creating unique <unk> models for each character 's body 
 In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements 
 They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay 
 The newer systems were decided upon early in development 
 The character designs were done by <unk> Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games 
 When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world 
 The main color of the Nameless was black 
 As with the previous Valkyria games , Valkyria Chronicles III used the <unk> graphics engine 
 The anime opening was produced by Production I
= = = Music = = =
The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who had also worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games 
 When he originally heard about the project , he thought it would be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games , but found the themes much darker than expected 
 An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected 
 He <unk> the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to <unk> the game 
 The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra , then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass , then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before <unk> segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme 
 The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game 's ending 
 The battle themes were designed around the concept of a " modern battle " divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments , constructed to create a sense of <unk> 
 While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music , he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar 
 The guitar was played by <unk> <unk> , who also arranged several of the later tracks
